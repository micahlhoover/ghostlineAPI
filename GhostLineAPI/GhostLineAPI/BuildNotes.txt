GhostLine API
	A library you can just add and it serves your C# objects (with easy authentication)

Run the nuget build like this:
	nuget pack GhostLineAPI.nuspec

Make sure to copy the bin/ dll to lib


Remaining work:
- Disable-able performance benchmarking
- Handle the calls in a slightly more HTTP compliant array (validate empty if POST)
